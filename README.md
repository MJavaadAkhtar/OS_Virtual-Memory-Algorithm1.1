# OS_Virtual-Memory-Algorithm1.1

For this project, I simulated the operation of page tables and page replacement.

I divided this project into to 2 major tasks, which will be based on a virtual memory simulator. The first task is to implement virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging using a two-level page table. The second task is to implement four different page replacement algorithms: FIFO, Clock, exact LRU, and OPT.

### Task 1

Implemented virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging using a two-level pagetable.

### Task 2
Implemented each of the four different page replacement algorithms: FIFO, exact LRU, CLOCK (with one ref-bit), OPT.

__Hashtable data structure__ is used to implement page replacement algorithms.
